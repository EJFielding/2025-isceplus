# Data Search and Access

**Resource:**

+ Data_Access_Accounts.ipynb
+ Search_and_Download_Test.ipynb

Start with `Data_Access_Accounts.ipynb` to see the required accounts, and links to the appropriate sites to sign up for them. If you don't already have EarthData or OpenTopography accounts, then you need to register as described there.

**Expected Outcome:** Students establish the necessary credentials and agreements to download data from online repositories of SAR imagery and topography. They can execute SSARA searches based on criteria of interest (satellite platform, date ranges, area of interest).

**Assessment:** Short exercise to download Sentinel-1 data and a digital elevation model.

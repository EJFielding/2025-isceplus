# Tropo + Ionosphere + Split Spectrum

**Resource:** 

+ Tropospheric and Ionospheric Noise correction theory
+ Troposphere/Tropo.ipynb

**Expected Outcome:** Develop and understanding of the typical signatures of the troposphere and ionosphere in InSAR data, its spatial and temporal variability, wavelength dependence (or not), ways to estimate or model, and expected improvements.

**Assessment:** Execute the self-directed notebook and inspect the results
